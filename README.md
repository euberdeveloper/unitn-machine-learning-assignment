# unitn-machine-learning-assignment
The assignment of the course "Introuction to machine learning" of UNITN (2020/2021)

## The project

The project consisted in training a neural network so that it could classify the type of a galaxy.

## The code

The code of this repository is not the code that has been really used. This is because most of the trials were done quickly with code that was not presentable to the teacher.

## The report

The report described what had been done and was to be submitted along with the code.

## The oral exam

The oral exam gave 60% of the final mark and regarded all the theorical/mathematical aspects of machine learning. It included, among the others: KNN, DT, SVM, backpropagation, CNN, PCA, VAE, GAN and Reinforcement Learning.

## The final mark

The final mark was **30 e lode**.
